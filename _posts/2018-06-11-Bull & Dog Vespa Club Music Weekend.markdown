Last month the Bull & Dog in Burscough played host to the Vespa Club of Wigan’s Dancing in Your Wellies weekend – raising £200 for charity in the process!

The event took place on Friday 18th May to Sunday 20th May with live bands and dozens of scooters in attendance.
Northern soul and ska was the soundtrack to the weekend, with many of the crowd camping out in tents and camper vans over the course of the three-day event.

A total of just over £200 was raised from the event, with proceeds going to Just B.U – a charity for adults with learning disabilities.
