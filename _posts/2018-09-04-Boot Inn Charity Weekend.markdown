The Boot Inn, in Sutton Coldfield, have raised an incredible £1059.60 for the Birmingham Children’s Hospital Charity!

The pub, which is located on Rectory Road, hosted a family fun weekend over the August Bank Holiday which saw customers get involved with activities such as; a bouncy castle, face painting, an inflatable penalty shootout, live music and a quiz night! All the staff wore fancy dress for the event, with prizes for customers who made the effort to dress up too.

As part of the weekend, the pub also took part in a 24-hour exercise bike ride! Many got involved to do their part – including Sofia, who is just one of the thousands that the Birmingham Children’s Hospital help each year!

After setting a target of raising £500 over the weekend, the Boot Inn finished with a staggering total of over £1,000 thanks to a flourish of donations across the 3 days.

A special mention goes out to the pub staff, regulars, new customers and local businesses that gave their time and/or money to help the fundraising event.
