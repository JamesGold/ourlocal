Over the past three years, Berlin’s Superbooth has become one of the world’s most exciting synth shows, bringing boutique instrument companies, Eurorack modular specialists and legacy manufacturers under one roof. FACT’s tech editor Scott Wilson visited the 2018 edition last week to see it for himself.

Anyone who’s been to a trade show will know that they can be a mixed bag: the compromise for early previews of hot new products is usually long lines, even longer wait times and sore feet from walking around gigantic, impersonal exhibition halls. As Berlin’s Superbooth proves though, it doesn’t have to be like that. Launched in 2016 by renowned Berlin synth shop SchneidersLaden, Superbooth has quickly developed a reputation as a must-visit synth expo for one key reason – it feels more like a close-knit community gathering than a trade show.

This year’s Superbooth – which took place at a family entertainment and education complex on the outskirts of the city from May 3–5 – was held in a bigger space than its former home of broadcast complex Funkhaus, but the vibe still felt intimate. And though big companies like Roland and Korg were in attendance, their presence was dwarfed by the hundreds of Eurorack companies showing off their oscillators, LFOs and other innovative modules to make noises with. In fact, it was impossible to find anywhere across the site that wasn’t bathed in a cloud of modular bleeps.

However, with the stands covering two floors and four main areas, Superbooth was far from compact; if you wanted to try out everything properly you’d probably need more than the show’s three days. I didn’t see everything by any means, but here’s some of what I did see that made an impression.
