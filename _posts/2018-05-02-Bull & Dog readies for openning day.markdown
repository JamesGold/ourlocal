The first of the Our Local sites opens this Friday (4th May) in the north west of England, and we can’t wait! 
Located on Liverpool Road in Burscough, the Bull & Dog has undergone a significant refurbishment to make it a home from home – a proper<!--more--> local pub.

The refurbishment includes furniture being replaced, the outside of the pub being re-painted, and a new play area being constructed!
New publicans Sabrina and Richie have lived in nearby Ormskirk for over 20 years and have a wide background in the local area – including running a plumbing and heating business.
Joining the couple in the pub will be two of their five children – with son Billy working behind the bar and younger son Tommy in the kitchen! 
The Bull & Dog opens its doors to the public on Friday – come on down and see what it’s all about.
