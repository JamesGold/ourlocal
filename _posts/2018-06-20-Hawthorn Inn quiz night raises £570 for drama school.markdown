Last week, [the Hawthorn Inn in Pontypridd] hosted a fundraising quiz for local drama school [Stage Left Drama Academy].

The event included a raffle and was attended by dozens – raising a huge £570 for the Pontypridd drama school in total!
The performing arts theatre group are based at the Rhydfelin Community Centre and give children the chance to perform productions such as Grease and Cinderella!
