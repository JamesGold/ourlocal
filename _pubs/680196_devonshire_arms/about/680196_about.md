**Jane and the team would like to welcome you to our beautiful pub. Recently refurbished, the Devonshire sits right in the heart of Hartington, the beautiful village at the northern end of Dovedale in the scenic and ever popular Derbyshire Peak District.**

Our fantastic team will ensure you feel at home, be it sat by the toasty fire during the winter months, or basking in the sunshine in our garden, there’s something for all. 

The Devonshire Arms is the perfect place to stop and relax whilst visiting the area for a tasty lunch, whether by yourself or with friends and family.  We have three luxury double bedrooms, available all year round.

We serve a delicious seasonal local menu with something for everyone. From the bar you’ll find a range of cask ales, craft beer, lager and cider alongside an extensive selection of wines, gins and soft drinks. 

## Perfectly situated in the Peak:

Hartington village is set in some of the very best walking country in the UK - we have a dog walking club every Saturday and Sunday morning at 9am, so your furry friends can also join in! Walking however is just one of the reasons to visit. It also has 65 miles of off-road dedicated cycling trails and over 34 miles of disused railways: High Peak Trail, Tissington Trail and Monsal Trail, with cycle-hire centres at Ashbourne, Parsley Hay, Derwent Valley and Middleton Top.

Did you know that the Peak District National Park was the first of Britain's 15 national parks? Reaching into five counties: Derbyshire, Cheshire, Staffordshire, Yorkshire, Greater Manchester. It is the most accessible national park – close to Manchester, Sheffield, Derby and Nottingham.

With around 13.25 million visitors every year the the Peak District is one of the most visited national parks in the UK and the Devonshire Arms is situated to be a perfect resting place, either for a drink, a meal or staying little longer in one of our luxury rooms.

*We look forward to meeting you.*
