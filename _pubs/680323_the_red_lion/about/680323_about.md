**The Red Lion is a stunning village pub located in the Yorkshire village of Burley in Wharfedale, just a short distance from the town of Ilkley.**

Located on Main Street, we’re renowned for our quality food and real ales. These are complemented by a comprehensive range of craft beers, wines, spirits, fresh coffee and soft drinks.

From the kitchen, we have a great menu with mouth-watering dishes such as beef & ale stew in a large Yorkshire pudding! 

On Thursdays from 9.30pm, come down and test your general knowledge at one of our quiz nights!

Whether you are a local to the area or just visiting, our friendly team will make you feel at home. We’re even dog-friendly in our bar area!
