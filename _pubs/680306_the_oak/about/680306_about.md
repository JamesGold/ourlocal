**The Oak is a fantastic pub in Hoghton, an affluent village located just outside of Preston.**
Situated on Hoghton Lane, the Oak pub is a great pit stop for walkers and cyclists in the local area. If you’re after a night out, why not come down to one of our events? We’ve got a quiz night, acoustic music, Murder Mystery nights, Wine & Cheese evenings… the list goes on!

From the bar you can enjoy a great range of drinks including real ales, lagers, gins, wines and soft drinks.

From the kitchen, we’ve introduced a delicious new menu with even more dishes to choose from including a beef and ale stew inside a Yorkshire pudding!

The Oak is a true village pub that’s family-friendly with something for everyone. Whether you’re a local or passing by, we’ll make sure you feel at home.


## About us, the Publicans

The Oak is run today by myself (Marcelle) and my husband Kevin! We both have previously worked on power stations, but we both share a huge love for pubs – I’ve managed family pubs for my Grandad for over 10 years!
We can’t wait to welcome you to the Oak and we’re excited to see you soon.
