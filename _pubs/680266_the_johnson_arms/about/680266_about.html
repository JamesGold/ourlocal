<hr />

<p><strong>The Johnson Arms is a traditional community pub in Nottingham.</strong></p>

<p>Located on Abbey Road not far from the University and Queen’s Medical Centre, we’re renowned for our quality food and fantastic real ales. These are complemented by a comprehensive range of lagers, ciders, wines, spirits, fresh coffee and soft drinks.</p>

<p>From the kitchen, enjoy our great new menu with even more dishes to choose from! Our new dishes include smoked haddock in Cheddar sauce and a beef &amp; ale stew in a large Yorkshire pudding. Not to mention your usual grills and burgers!</p>

<p>We have Sky Sports showing some of the best sporting events you would expect to see. And on a Monday, we’ve got our quiz night! In the summer months, relax with a cold refreshing pint in our large beer garden.</p>

<p>Whether you are a local to the area or just visiting, our friendly team will make you feel at home.</p>
