**The Johnson Arms is a traditional community pub in Nottingham.**

Located on Abbey Road not far from the University and Queen’s Medical Centre, we’re renowned for our quality food and fantastic real ales. These are complemented by a comprehensive range of lagers, ciders, wines, spirits, fresh coffee and soft drinks.

From the kitchen, enjoy our great new menu with even more dishes to choose from! Our new dishes include smoked haddock in Cheddar sauce and a beef & ale stew in a large Yorkshire pudding. Not to mention your usual grills and burgers!

We have Sky Sports showing some of the best sporting events you would expect to see. And on a Monday, we’ve got our quiz night! In the summer months, relax with a cold refreshing pint in our large beer garden.

Whether you are a local to the area or just visiting, our friendly team will make you feel at home.
