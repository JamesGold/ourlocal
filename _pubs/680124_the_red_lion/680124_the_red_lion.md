<p><strong>Welcome to The Red Lion</strong></p>

<p>The Red Lion has had a fantastic refurbishment and our brand new team are looking forward to serving you with our new range of drinks and substantial great new menu of pub classics.</p>

<p>We have everything covered. Enjoy relaxing in our bar, trying our new cask ales whilst watching the live sports events. Alternatively enjoy fresh air in our new outside drinking area with a refreshing bottle of Prosecco. Our new menu will certainly not disappoint and our various food offers will ensure you come back throughout the week. The little ones are catered for with a childrenâ€™s menu to keep them full and free crayons to colour in pictures, will keep them entertained.</p>
