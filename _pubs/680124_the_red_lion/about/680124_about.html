<p><strong>The Red Lion in Wellingborough is a recently-refurbished community pub with a great new food menu. It’s a pub you’ll be proud to call your local.</strong></p>

<p>Situated in the historic village of Bozeat, which was at the heart of a thriving weaving industry around 600 years ago, The Red Lion has something to offer for everyone.</p>

<p>As well as serving a fantastic drinks range and delicious menu, the Red Lion is dedicated to providing you with a range of entertainment that will keep you wanting to come back time and time again. We have a pub quiz night, a bingo night, plus live bands and entertainment across the weekend!</p>

<p>In the warmer months, you can enjoy our huge beer garden! We’ve even got free WiFi…</p>

<p><em>See you soon, Marilyn</em></p>
