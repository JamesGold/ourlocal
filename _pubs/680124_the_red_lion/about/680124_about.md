**The Red Lion in Wellingborough is a recently-refurbished community pub. It’s a pub you’ll be proud to call your local.**

Situated in the historic village of Bozeat, which was at the heart of a thriving weaving industry around 600 years ago, The Red Lion has something to offer for everyone. 

As well as serving a fantastic range of drinks, the Red Lion is dedicated to providing you with a range of entertainment that will keep you wanting to come back time and time again. We have a pub quiz night, a bingo night, plus live bands and entertainment across the weekend! 

In the warmer months, you can enjoy our huge beer garden! We’ve even got free WiFi…

*See you soon, Marilyn*
