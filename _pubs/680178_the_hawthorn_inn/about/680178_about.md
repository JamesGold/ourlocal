**The Hawthorn Inn in Pontypridd is everything you’d expect from a great local pub. Having undergone a major investment in 2017, the pub is now looking better than ever before.**

Situated on the main road through the small village of Hawthorn, this stylish pub offers something for everyone. Whether you’re looking for a game of pool with your mates, a traditional pub meal or want to watch the football – the Hawthorn Inn is your home from home.
Our menus serve a fantastic range of freshly prepared traditional pub meals – not to mention the great offers that run alongside them!

We also pride ourselves on having a superb drinks range! There’s a selection of local and regional ales, a fantastic choice of spirits and wines, plus your favourite soft drinks!
