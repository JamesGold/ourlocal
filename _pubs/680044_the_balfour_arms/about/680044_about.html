<p><strong>The Balfour Arms is a fantastic community pub that you would be proud to call your local.</strong></p>

<p>Situated on Woolbrook Road in Sidmouth, the Balfour Arms has always been a popular pub thanks to its great location at the heart of the Woolbrook Estate.
It’s a true community pub that’s family friendly with something for everyone. It’s a place where you’re always welcome.</p>

<p>From the kitchen, we’ve introduced a great new menu with even more dishes to choose from.</p>

<p>We’ll also be stepping up our entertainment programme to include more live music alongside regular quiz, poker and bingo nights!
We have Sky Sports and BT Sport showing all the sporting events you would expect to see. In the warmer months, chill out in our beer garden and grab a drink at the outdoor bar. And for the kids, we’ve got a brand-new play park coming soon – the only one of its kind in Sidmouth.</p>

<p>Don’t worry, we haven’t forgot the dogs either. That’s right – our four-legged friends are welcome inside and out!
Looking for the perfect function venue? We’ve got that covered too! We can cater for up to 200 people.</p>
