**The Crown & Glove is an attractive stone-built pub located in Stannington, a suburb of the city of Sheffield.**

Situated on Upper Gate Road, the pub enjoys a prominent hilltop position just half a mile away from the stunning Peak District.

At the Crown & Glove we’re renowned for our real ales and these are complemented by a comprehensive range of lagers, craft beers, wines, spirits, hot drinks and soft drinks.

From the kitchen, we’ve introduced a great new menu with even more dishes to choose from including smoked haddock in Cheddar sauce and a beef & ale stew in a large Yorkshire pudding! 

The pub is split into three characterful areas; we have a main bar area, a lovely lounge area and a cosy snug. Our snug can also double as a meeting room. We’ve even got traditional log fires!

We have free WiFi throughout the pub and a beer terrace for you to enjoy a drink in during the warmer months.

Whether you are a local to the area or just visiting, our friendly team will make you feel at home.
