<p><strong>The Crown &amp; Glove is an attractive stone-built pub located in Stannington, a suburb of the city of Sheffield.</strong></p>

<p>Situated on Upper Gate Road, the pub enjoys a prominent hilltop position just half a mile away from the stunning Peak District.</p>

<p>At the Crown &amp; Glove we’re renowned for our real ales and these are complemented by a comprehensive range of lagers, craft beers, wines, spirits, hot drinks and soft drinks.</p>

<p>From the kitchen, we’ve introduced a great new menu with even more dishes to choose from including smoked haddock in Cheddar sauce and a beef &amp; ale stew in a large Yorkshire pudding!</p>

<p>The pub is split into three characterful areas; we have a main bar area, a lovely lounge area and a cosy snug. Our snug can also double as a meeting room. We’ve even got traditional log fires!</p>

<p>We have free WiFi throughout the pub and a beer terrace for you to enjoy a drink in during the warmer months.</p>

<p>Whether you are a local to the area or just visiting, our friendly team will make you feel at home.</p>
