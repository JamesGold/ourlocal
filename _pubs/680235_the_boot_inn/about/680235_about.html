<p>The Boot Inn’s building and its adjacent malthouse were built in the 1800s to serve the local community. The job of inn-keeping was not enough for the person living there, so Joseph James moved into the Boot in 1843. James was a Cordwainer – a maker of boots and shoes.</p>

<p>James displayed a boot outside his premises to advertise his trade – so the reputation of the beer to be drank at the sign of the boot spread around the district.</p>

<p>The Boot Inn was first named in in the 1870s and was regarded as the centre of the growing community – which it still is today.</p>
