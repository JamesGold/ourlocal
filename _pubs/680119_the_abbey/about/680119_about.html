<p><strong>The Abbey in Sheffield is a fantastic community pub that you will be proud to call your local.</strong></p>

<p>Situated on Chesterfield Road in the village of Woodseats, The Abbey is the perfect pub for a relaxed, community pub environment.</p>

<p>Enjoy relaxing in our snug whilst trying our new craft cask ales, or out on our large landscaped terrace with a refreshing bottle of prosecco after work. Your weekend nights out are also covered with regular entertainment and a wide range of spirits and popular bottled drinks.</p>

<p>Our food menus serve a great range of pub favourites but with a modern twist. All freshly prepared within our state of the art kitchen, we are confident you will want to come back for more.</p>

<p><strong>And for sport fans, we have TV screens showing all the biggest matches, plus a pool table!</strong></p>
