<hr />

<p><strong>The Boars Head is a stunning, country pub located in the quaint village of Higher Poynton – the gateway into one of the National Trust’s crown jewels; Lyme Park.</strong></p>

<p>Situated on Shrigley Road North, our dog-friendly pub is a popular spot for families, walkers and cyclists.</p>

<p>Walkers may leave their vehicles at the pub before venturing into the park’s stunning 1,400 acres on foot. Further cherished countryside treasures — the Macclesfield Canal and Middlewood Way — are both just a stone’s throw away.</p>

<p>From the kitchen, you can enjoy our tasty seasonal menu. We’ve got everything from your pub classic favourites to lighter, healthier options. We also have a great Sunday menu – perfect for treating loved ones.</p>

<p>From the bar we offer an extensive range of cask ales and fine lagers alongside a wide selection of wine and some amazing flavoured gins.</p>

<p>We have our new quiz night on Thursdays, live music on Fridays and both Sky Sports &amp; BT Sport to cover the weekend’s sporting action.</p>

<p>A pub for everyone to enjoy.</p>

<p><em>We look forward to seeing you soon.</em></p>
