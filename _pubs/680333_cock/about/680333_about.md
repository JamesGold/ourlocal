**The Cock is a cosy, characterful pub situated close to the river in the Yorkshire village of Oughtibridge.**

Located on Bridge Hill, the Cock is at the heart of the local community and there has been a pub on this site for over 200 years! 

From the kitchen, you can enjoy a delicious seasonal menu in the warmth of the main room. From the bar, we offer a range of cask ales, lager, craft beer and cider alongside a wide selection of wine and gins. 

Sports fans are able to enjoy the biggest games on our HD screens. 

*In the summer, sit back and relax in our beer garden. Itâ€™s the perfect spot to soak up some sun!*
