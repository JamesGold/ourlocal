<hr />

<p><strong>The Cock is a cosy, characterful pub situated close to the river in the Yorkshire village of Oughtibridge.</strong></p>

<p>Located on Bridge Hill, the Cock is at the heart of the local community and there has been a pub on this site for over 200 years!</p>

<p>From the kitchen, you can enjoy a delicious seasonal menu in the warmth of the main room. From the bar, we offer a range of cask ales, lager, craft beer and cider alongside a wide selection of wine and gins.</p>

<p>Sports fans are able to enjoy the biggest games on our HD screens.</p>

<p><em>In the summer, sit back and relax in our beer garden. Itâ€™s the perfect spot to soak up some sun!</em></p>
