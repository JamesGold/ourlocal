**The Royal Oak is a traditional pub right at the heart of the award-winning village of Higher Kinnerton – located between Chester and Wrexham.**

This impressive 17th Century inn offers something for everyone and every occasion. Whether that’s a quick pint after work with your mates in the beamed bar lounge area, or a relaxing meal with a loved one in the modern conservatory dining room. 

In the summer you can choose from two beer gardens to meet, eat and drink in. In the winter months, settle down by the open fire in the bar and catch up with friends old and new.

Our extensive menus serve the best of traditional pub food. Featuring reworked classic English dishes with creative and tasty touches, you owe it to yourself to try one of our delicious meals.

We also pride ourselves on having a great drinks range! There’s a selection of local and regional ales, a fantastic choice of spirits and wines, plus your favourite soft drinks!
