**The White Hart is a fantastic, traditional pub located in the beautiful Cheshire village of Hough, just outside of Crewe.**

From the kitchen, you can enjoy our delicious seasonal menu. We also have a great Sunday menu – perfect for treating loved ones.

From the bar, we offer a range of cask ales, lager, craft beer and cider alongside a wide selection of wine and gins.


Wednesday nights here at the White Hart are our popular quiz nights - £1 entry fee per player with the winner taking all.

A local pub for everyone to enjoy.

*We look forward to seeing you soon.*
