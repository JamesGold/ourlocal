<hr />

<p><strong>The Meadow House is a fantastic country pub that you would be proud to call your local.</strong></p>

<p>Situated on North Road in Berwick-upon-Tweed, the Meadow House is known as the ‘First and Last Pub in England’ due to the Scottish border only being a mile away!</p>

<p>It’s a true rural pub that’s family-friendly with something for everyone. A place where you’re always welcome.</p>

<p>From the kitchen, you can enjoy a delicious seasonal menu with many dishes to choose from. Our Sunday roasts alone are worth popping in for!</p>

<p>We’ll also be stepping up our entertainment programme to include movie nights, a monthly quiz night, live music – as well as a range of food themed nights such as curry night.</p>

<p>If it’s live sport you’re after, we’ve got that covered too! Our TV screens will be showing all the biggest matches on BT Sport.</p>

<p>In the warmer months, soak up the rays in our large beer garden. And don’t worry, we haven’t forgot the dogs either. That’s right – our four-legged friends are welcome!</p>
