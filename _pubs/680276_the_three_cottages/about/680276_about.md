**The Three Cottages is a fantastic and historic pub that you will be proud to call your local. Located on the outskirts of Hasland, a small village on the south side of the historic market town of Chesterfield, the Three Cottages is everything you expect from a village pub. A place where you’re always welcome and relaxed, whether you’re by yourself or with loved ones.**

The Cottages Front Room is where our drinkers relax and enjoy a pint from our fine selection of Cask Marque accredited beers, or a tipple from our amazing range of gins, whiskeys, and spirits.  We also host events from Murder Mystery Nights to Whisky Tasting evenings.

Our menus serve the best of traditional pub food. Featuring reworked classic English dishes with creative and tasty touches, you owe it to yourself to try one of our delicious meals. We’ve even got our own famous range of home-made pies! 
Put simply, we want all our wonderful customers to kick back, relax and enjoy your time spent with us.  


## Our History
				
**The Three Cottages has been around for over 100 years! And as the name suggests, the building was previously three dwellings.**

In the early 1900s, the largest of the three was turned into a public house and was the local drinking hole. Then in the 1960s, the three cottages were merged into one - which was named The New Inn.

Currently named with a nod to our heritage, the Three Cottages certainly retains all the warmth and charm of years gone by.
