<h2 id="ourhistory">Our History</h2>

<p><strong>The Three Cottages has been around for over 100 years! And as the name suggests, the building was previously three dwellings.</strong></p>

<p>In the early 1900s, the largest of the three was turned into a public house and was the local drinking hole. Then in the 1960s, the three cottages were merged into one - which was named The New Inn.</p>

<p>Currently named with a nod to our heritage, the Three Cottages certainly retains all the warmth and charm of years gone by.		</p>
