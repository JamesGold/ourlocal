**The New Inn is a beautiful, traditional pub located right on the Stainforth and Keadby Canal in Doncaster.**

Situated on Southbank, the New Inn is the perfect place for you to relax and wind down.

From the kitchen, you can enjoy our delicious seasonal menu. We also have a great Sunday menu â€“ perfect for treating loved ones.

From the bar, we offer a range of cask ales, lager, craft beer and cider alongside an extensive selection of wines, gins and rums. 

We have a darts board and pool table to keep you entertained after an afternoon watching the canal boats come past. 

A local pub for everyone to enjoy.

*We look forward to seeing you soon.*
