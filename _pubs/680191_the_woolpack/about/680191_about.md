**The Woolpack is a beautiful pub located in the small town of Yeadon, just north west of Leeds.**

Situated on New Road, we’re renowned for our tasty food and quality real ales. These are complemented by a comprehensive range of craft beers, wines, spirits, fresh coffee and soft drinks.

From the kitchen, we’ve introduced a great new menu with even more dishes to choose from including smoked haddock in Cheddar sauce and a beef & ale stew in a large Yorkshire pudding! 

We have Sky Sports showing some of the best sporting events you would expect to see. On a Thursday, we’ve got our ever-popular quiz night and we’ve also got live entertainment every Friday!

In the warmer months, enjoy a cold refreshing pint in our lovely beer garden area.
