<p><strong>The Woolpack is a beautiful pub located in the small town of Yeadon, just north west of Leeds.</strong></p>

<p>Situated on New Road, we’re renowned for our tasty food and quality real ales. These are complemented by a comprehensive range of craft beers, wines, spirits, fresh coffee and soft drinks.</p>

<p>From the kitchen, we’ve introduced a great new menu with even more dishes to choose from including smoked haddock in Cheddar sauce and a beef &amp; ale stew in a large Yorkshire pudding!</p>

<p>We have Sky Sports showing some of the best sporting events you would expect to see. On a Thursday, we’ve got our ever-popular quiz night and we’ve also got live entertainment every Friday!</p>

<p>In the warmer months, enjoy a cold refreshing pint in our lovely beer garden area.</p>
