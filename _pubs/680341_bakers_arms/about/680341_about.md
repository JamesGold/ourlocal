**The Bakers Arms is a fantastic, traditional pub located in the thriving market town of Alton in Hampshire.**

Situated on High Street, the Bakers Arms is right at the heart of the local community.

From the bar, we offer a range of cask ales, lager, craft beer and cider alongside an extensive selection of wines, gins and rums. 

We have darts and pool leagues and for sports fans, we show all the biggest matches on our screens.

Well behaved dogs are welcome and children can stay until 7pm with well-behaved parents!

A local pub for everyone to enjoy.

*We look forward to seeing you soon.*
