<p><strong>The Jolly Roger is a fantastic community pub that you would be proud to call your local.</strong></p>

<p>Situated on Priory Road, the Jolly Roger has always been a popular pub thanks to its great location on the waterfront overlooking Portsmouth Harbour.</p>

<p>In the bar area expect a traditional feel… old oak beams, crab &amp; lobster traps, a cosy fireplace.</p>

<p>From the kitchen, we’ve introduced a great new menu with even more dishes to choose from including a beef and ale stew inside a Yorkshire pudding!</p>

<p>We’ll also be stepping up our entertainment programme to include more live music alongside regular quiz nights!</p>

<p>The Jolly Roger is a true community pub that’s family friendly with something for everyone. It’s a place where you’re always welcome.</p>
