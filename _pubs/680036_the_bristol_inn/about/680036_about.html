<p><strong>The Bristol Inn is a fantastic traditional village pub that you would be proud to call your local.</strong></p>

<p>Situated at the heart of the Clevedon community, a small village just outside Bristol, the Bristol Inn is your home from home. A place where you’re always welcome and relaxed.</p>

<p>In the bar area you can sit back and enjoy a drink from our great range – whether that’s a real cask ale, a G&amp;T or one of our whiskeys.</p>

<p>If it’s a hearty meal you’re after, relax in our separate restaurant area and let the kitchen team serve you up a real treat! There’s grills, burgers, kebabs chicken… and if you’re only after a light bite, why not try our Caesar salad or a warm sandwich?</p>

<h2 id="greatforentertainment">Great for entertainment</h2>

<p>The Bristol Inn is also dedicated to providing you with a range of entertainment that will keep you wanting to come back time and time again. From live entertainment on a Saturday night to our new Sunday Night Clever Clogs Clevedon Pub Quiz, we’ve got something that’s sure to make you smile. In the summer months, we even have a bouncy castle in our great beer garden for the young ones!</p>
