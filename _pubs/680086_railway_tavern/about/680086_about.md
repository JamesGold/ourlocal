**The Railway Tavern is a fantastic traditional pub that you would be proud to call your local.**

Located at the heart of the Charfield community, on the outskirts of Wotton-under-Edge, the Railway Tavern is a place where you’re always welcome and relaxed.

In the bar area you can sit back and enjoy a drink from our great range – whether that’s a real cask ale, a G&T or one of our whiskeys. 

From the kitchen, we are proud of our new menus we serve. Whether it’s a business lunch or an evening meal out with friends and family, there are plenty of pleasant surprises to try and enjoy.

The little ones are catered for also with a children’s menu to keep them full and free crayons to colour in pictures and keep them entertained.

We also show BT Sport – so you can pop in for a pint whilst the game’s on.
