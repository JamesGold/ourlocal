<p><strong>The Railway Tavern is a fantastic traditional pub that you would be proud to call your local.</strong></p>

<p>Located at the heart of the Charfield community, on the outskirts of Wotton-under-Edge, the Railway Tavern is a place where you’re always welcome and relaxed.</p>

<p>In the bar area you can sit back and enjoy a drink from our great range – whether that’s a real cask ale, a G&amp;T or one of our whiskeys.</p>

<p>From the kitchen, we are proud of our new menus we serve. Whether it’s a business lunch or an evening meal out with friends and family, there are plenty of pleasant surprises to try and enjoy.</p>

<p>The little ones are catered for also with a children’s menu to keep them full and free crayons to colour in pictures and keep them entertained.</p>

<p>We also show BT Sport – so you can pop in for a pint whilst the game’s on.</p>
