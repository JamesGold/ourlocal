**The Peg & Parrot is a fantastic, traditional British pub located in Totton, just a few miles from Southampton.**

Situated on Rumbridge Street, the pub has been right at the heart of the local community for over 150 years!

From the bar, we offer a range of cask ales, lager, craft beer and cider alongside an extensive selection of wines, gins and soft drinks.

At the Peg & Parrot we have both Sky Sports and BT Sport on our HD screens, meaning you won’t have to miss a minute of any of the biggest games! We’ll be showing everything from the Premier League and Champions League to rugby and cricket.

We have a number of events throughout the week, with our popular meat raffle taking place every Friday and monthly live music on a Saturday. We also have live music on a Sunday!

*A local pub for everyone to enjoy*
