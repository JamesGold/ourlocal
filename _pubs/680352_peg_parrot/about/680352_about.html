<p><strong>The Peg &amp; Parrot is a fantastic, traditional British pub located in Totton, just a few miles from Southampton.</strong></p>

<p>Situated on Rumbridge Street, the pub has been right at the heart of the local community for over 150 years!</p>

<p>From the bar, we offer a range of cask ales, lager, craft beer and cider alongside an extensive selection of wines, gins and soft drinks.</p>

<p>At the Peg &amp; Parrot we have both Sky Sports and BT Sport on our HD screens, meaning you won’t have to miss a minute of any of the biggest games! We’ll be showing everything from the Premier League and Champions League to rugby and cricket.</p>

<p>We have a number of events throughout the week, with our popular meat raffle taking place every Friday and monthly live music on a Saturday. We also have live music on a Sunday!</p>

<p><em>A local pub for everyone to enjoy</em></p>
