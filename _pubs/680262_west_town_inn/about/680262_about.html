<p><strong>The West Town Inn is a lovely community pub that you would be proud to call your local.</strong></p>

<p>First opened in 1878, the West Town Inn is located on Hayling Island – an island just across the water from nearby Portsmouth. And it’s everything you’d expect from a traditional pub. A place where you’re always welcome to enjoy a pint whilst watching <strong>live sport</strong> with friends or for a quiet meal with loved ones.</p>

<p>We have <strong>Sky Sports</strong>, <strong>BT Sports</strong> AND <strong>Racing UK</strong> showing all the sporting events you would expect to see. If you fancy playing, take advantage of our pool table &amp; darts board to put your skills to the test whilst enjoying our great range of drinks and offers.</p>

<p>Looking for a bite to eat? Our menus serve the best of traditional pub food. Featuring reworked classic English dishes with creative and tasty touches, you owe it to yourself to try one of our delicious meals.
Put simply, we want you to kick back, relax, and come to enjoy your time in a friendly pub with us.</p>

<p><em>Cheers, Sharron &amp; Neil</em></p>
