**The Turnpike is a fantastic community pub located in the Cheshire town of Middlewich.**

Situated on Warmingham Lane, the Turnpike pub is right at the heart of the local community.

Here, we serve a delicious seasonal menu with something for everyone. We also have a fantastic Sunday menu – perfect for treating loved ones. 

From the bar, we offer a range of cask ales, lager, craft beer and cider alongside an extensive selection of wines, gins and soft drinks. 

At the Turnpike we have both Sky Sports and BT Sport on our HD screens, meaning you won’t have to miss a minute of any of the biggest games! We’ll be showing everything from the Premier League and Six Nations to 
cricket and horse racing.

We have our popular pub quiz on a Tuesday, with live entertainment on a weekend.

*A local pub for everyone to enjoy.*
