<p><strong>The Turnpike is a fantastic community pub located in the Cheshire town of Middlewich.</strong></p>

<p>Situated on Warmingham Lane, the Turnpike pub is right at the heart of the local community.</p>

<p>Here, we serve a delicious seasonal menu with something for everyone. We also have a fantastic Sunday menu – perfect for treating loved ones.</p>

<p>From the bar, we offer a range of cask ales, lager, craft beer and cider alongside an extensive selection of wines, gins and soft drinks.</p>

<p>At the Turnpike we have both Sky Sports and BT Sport on our HD screens, meaning you won’t have to miss a minute of any of the biggest games! We’ll be showing everything from the Premier League and Six Nations to
