**The Bedes Lea is a family-friendly pub located in the Hampshire village of North Baddesley, just outside Southampton.**

Situated on Rownhams Lane, the Bedes Lea is right at the heart of the local community.

From the kitchen, you can enjoy our delicious seasonal menu. We also have a great Sunday menu – perfect for treating loved ones.

From the bar, we offer a range of cask ales, lager, craft beer and cider alongside an extensive selection of wines, gins and rums. 

At the Bedes Lea we have both Sky Sports and BT Sport on our HD screens, meaning you won’t have to miss a minute of any of the biggest games! We’ll be showing everything from the Premier League and Six Nations to horse racing and tennis.

We also have darts, pool and crib teams – the perfect chance for you to represent your local pub and community.

On weekends throughout the year we’ll also have the very best local live entertainment!

Looking for somewhere to host an event? Our amazing conservatory space can be hired out for parties and other functions.

*A local pub for everyone to enjoy.*
