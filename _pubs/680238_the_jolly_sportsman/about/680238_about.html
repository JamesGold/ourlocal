<p><strong>The Jolly Sportsman is a traditional community pub located in the market town of Chesham, Buckinghamshire.</strong></p>

<p>First opened in 1843, the pub is minutes from the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and it’s a pub you would be proud to call your local.</p>

<p>It’s everything you’d expect from a real British pub. It serves great beer, shows live sport and has an offer or entertainment every single night of the week.</p>

<p>Whether you’re with loved ones, friends or by yourself, we’ll ensure you feel at home. Put simply, we want you to kick back, relax, and come to enjoy your time with us.</p>

<p><em>Cheers, Owen</em></p>
