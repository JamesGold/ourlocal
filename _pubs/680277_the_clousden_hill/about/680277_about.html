<h2 id="aboutusthepublicans">About us, the Publicans</h2>

<p>The Clousden Hill is run today by myself (Elaine) and my husband Stevie! We both share a huge love for pubs – we’re also in charge of The Bridge, a lovely pub just down the road in Annitsford. Our own love story even began in a Longbenton pub!</p>

<p>I’m originally from Southport but have been living in the North East for the last 32 years, and this is where I met Stevie!</p>

<p>We began pulling pints together in 2010 and have done so ever since! I’ve been involved in the hospitality industry for over 20 years, whilst Stevie was previously a mechanic.</p>

<p>We have 3 children and 4 wonderful grandchildren, so family is very important to us. And that’s why we’re going to make sure the Clousden Hill is a real community, family-friendly local.</p>

<p><em>We look forward to seeing you soon.</em></p>
