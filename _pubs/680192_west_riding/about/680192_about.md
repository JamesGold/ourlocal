**The West Riding is a fantastic traditional pub located in Leeds city centre, just a stone’s throw from Leeds Railway Station and City Square.**

Situated on Wellington Street, the West Riding pub is the perfect place for you to relax with a refreshing pint or tasty meal after a day shopping or at work.

From the kitchen, you can taste our delicious seasonal menu. We also have a great Sunday menu – perfect for treating loved ones.

From the bar, we offer a wide range of cask ales, lager, and cider alongside an extensive selection of wines and gins. 

At the West Riding we’re also renowned for live sport. We’ve got all the biggest games on Sky Sports and BT Sport, as well as the horses on Racing UK! We’re talking the Championship, Premier League, Champions League, Six Nations, Formula One, boxing…

A local pub for everyone to enjoy.

*We look forward to seeing you soon.*
