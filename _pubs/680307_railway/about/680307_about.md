**The Railway is a beautiful, traditional pub located in the market town of Ramsbottom just a few miles from Bury.**

Situated on Bridge Street opposite Ramsbottom train station, the Railway pub is right at the heart of the local community.

From the kitchen, you can enjoy our delicious seasonal menu. We also have a fantastic Sunday menu – perfect for treating loved ones. Breakfast is served daily from 9am.

From the bar, we offer a range of cask ales, lager, craft beer and cider alongside an extensive selection of wines, gins and rums. 

Outside, sit back and relax in the Courtyard, our amazing dining area and bar! It’s the perfect place for you to enjoy a G&T or an ice cold beer.

At the Railway we have both Sky Sports and BT Sport on our HD screens, meaning you won’t have to miss a minute of any of the biggest games! We’ll be showing everything from the Premier League 
and Six Nations to cricket and more.

On every weekend throughout the year we’ll also have the very best local live entertainment!

*A local pub for everyone to enjoy… even our four-legged friends.*
