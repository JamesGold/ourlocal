<p><strong>The Railway is a beautiful, traditional pub located in the market town of Ramsbottom just a few miles from Bury.</strong></p>

<p>Situated on Bridge Street opposite Ramsbottom train station, the Railway pub is right at the heart of the local community.</p>

<p>From the kitchen, you can enjoy our delicious seasonal menu. We also have a fantastic Sunday menu – perfect for treating loved ones. Breakfast is served daily from 9am.</p>

<p>From the bar, we offer a range of cask ales, lager, craft beer and cider alongside an extensive selection of wines, gins and rums.</p>

<p>Outside, sit back and relax in the Courtyard, our amazing dining area and bar! It’s the perfect place for you to enjoy a G&amp;T or an ice cold beer.</p>

<p>At the Railway we have both Sky Sports and BT Sport on our HD screens, meaning you won’t have to miss a minute of any of the biggest games! We’ll be showing everything from the Premier League
and Six Nations to cricket and more.</p>

<p>On every weekend throughout the year we’ll also have the very best local live entertainment!</p>

<p><em>A local pub for everyone to enjoy… even our four-legged friends.</em></p>
