**The Griffin Inn is a fantastic pub that you would be proud to call your local.**

Located on Mold Road in Mynydd Isa, the Griffin Inn is family-friendly and is set right at the heart of the community.

From the kitchen, we’ve introduced a great new menu with even more dishes to choose from including smoked haddock in Cheddar sauce and a beef & ale stew in a large Yorkshire pudding! 

Behind the bar, we serve a wonderful range of drinks! From gins to ales, wines to lagers and refreshing soft drinks – we’ve got it all covered.

We have Sky Sports and BT Sport showing all the sporting events you would expect to see. In the warmer months, chill out in our beer garden and grab a drink at the outdoor bar. In the winter, our lovely outdoor terrace is heated! We also have a play area for the little ones!
