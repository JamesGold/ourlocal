<p><strong>The Griffin Inn is a fantastic pub that you would be proud to call your local.</strong></p>

<p>Located on Mold Road in Mynydd Isa, the Griffin Inn is family-friendly and is set right at the heart of the community.</p>

<p>From the kitchen, we’ve introduced a great new menu with even more dishes to choose from including smoked haddock in Cheddar sauce and a beef &amp; ale stew in a large Yorkshire pudding!</p>

<p>Behind the bar, we serve a wonderful range of drinks! From gins to ales, wines to lagers and refreshing soft drinks – we’ve got it all covered.</p>

<p>We have Sky Sports and BT Sport showing all the sporting events you would expect to see. In the warmer months, chill out in our beer garden and grab a drink at the outdoor bar. In the winter, our lovely outdoor terrace is heated! We also have a play area for the little ones!</p>
