**The Boot is a fantastic, traditional village pub located at the heart of Northop, Mold. It’s a pub that you’d be proud to call your local.**

From a fantastic drinks range to traditional pub food, live sport to a recently landscaped beer garden, it’s everything you’d expect from a great pub.

From the kitchen, we are proud of the food we serve. Whether it’s a business lunch or an evening meal out with friends and family, there are plenty of pleasant surprises for you to try. 

Behind the bar, we have a great range of premium lagers and real cask ales alongside our favourite wines.
We also have BT Sport showing all the sporting events you would expect to see!

## Our History
				
The Boot is one of the oldest inns in the village of Northop, probably pre-dating 1717 when a map indicated a substantial building on the site. 
Behind the pub can be found the Northop Brook, it retains the original ford with a stone slabbed pedestrian crossing.
