<p><strong>The Boot is a fantastic, traditional village pub located at the heart of Northop, Mold. It’s a pub that you’d be proud to call your local.</strong></p>

<p>From a fantastic drinks range to traditional pub food, live sport to a recently landscaped beer garden, it’s everything you’d expect from a great pub.</p>

<p>From the kitchen, we are proud of the food we serve. Whether it’s a business lunch or an evening meal out with friends and family, there are plenty of pleasant surprises for you to try.</p>

<p>Behind the bar, we have a great range of premium lagers and real cask ales alongside our favourite wines.
We also have BT Sport showing all the sporting events you would expect to see!</p>

<h2 id="ourhistory">Our History</h2>

<p>The Boot is one of the oldest inns in the village of Northop, probably pre-dating 1717 when a map indicated a substantial building on the site.
Behind the pub can be found the Northop Brook, it retains the original ford with a stone slabbed pedestrian crossing.</p>
