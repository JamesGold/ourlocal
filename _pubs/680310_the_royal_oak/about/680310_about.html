<p><strong>The Royal Oak is a fantastic community pub that you would be proud to call your local.</strong></p>

<p>The pub is situated on the main road through the popular village of Exminster, just on the outskirts of the cathedral city of Exeter.</p>

<p>It’s a true village pub that’s family-friendly with something for everyone. A place where you’re always welcome.</p>

<p>From the kitchen, you can enjoy a delicious seasonal menu with many dishes to choose from. Our Sunday roasts alone are worth popping in for!</p>

<p>In the warmer months, soak up the rays in our large beer garden while the children enjoy the play area. And don’t worry, we haven’t forgot the dogs either. That’s right – our four-legged friends are welcome!</p>
