**The Royal Oak is a fantastic community pub that you would be proud to call your local.**

The pub is situated on the main road through the popular village of Exminster, just on the outskirts of the cathedral city of Exeter.

It’s a true village pub that’s family-friendly with something for everyone. A place where you’re always welcome.

From the kitchen, you can enjoy a delicious seasonal menu with many dishes to choose from. Our Sunday roasts alone are worth popping in for!

In the warmer months, soak up the rays in our large beer garden while the children enjoy the play area. And don’t worry, we haven’t forgot the dogs either. That’s right – our four-legged friends are welcome!
