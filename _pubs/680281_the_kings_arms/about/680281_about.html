<hr />

<p><strong>The Kings Arms is a friendly, relaxed pub situated just 5 miles from Bath and Bradford-on-Avon.</strong></p>

<p>Located in the small village of Monkton Farleigh, the Kings Arms is a Grade II listed building that&#8217;s full of character! We&#8217;re talking exposed beams, original brick walls and one of the largest inglenook fireplaces in the country!</p>

<p>From the kitchen, you can enjoy a delicious seasonal menu by the fire in the main bar area or in the restaurant area.</p>

<p>The bar offers a range of cask ale, lager, craft beer and cider alongside a wide range of wine and gins.</p>

<p>In the warmer months, soak up the rays in our large beer garden. Itâ€™s the perfect spot for spending time with the family!</p>

<p>We also offer 5 B&amp;B rooms. Each room offers its own charm, is fully furnished and is a perfect base to explore North Devon. All rooms are en suite.</p>
