**The Kings Arms is a friendly, relaxed pub situated just 5 miles from Bath and Bradford-on-Avon.**

Located in the small village of Monkton Farleigh, the Kings Arms is a Grade II listed building that's full of character! We're talking exposed beams, original brick walls and one of the largest inglenook fireplaces in the country!

From the kitchen, you can enjoy a delicious seasonal menu by the fire in the main bar area or in the restaurant area. 

The bar offers a range of cask ale, lager, craft beer and cider alongside a wide range of wine and gins. 

In the warmer months, soak up the rays in our large beer garden. Itâ€™s the perfect spot for spending time with the family!

We also offer 5 B&B rooms. Each room offers its own charm, is fully furnished and is a perfect base to explore North Devon. All rooms are en suite.
