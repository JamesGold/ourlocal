**The The Kings Arms is a fantastic country pub that you would be proud to call your local.**

Situated on North Road in Berwick-upon-Tweed, the The Kings Arms is known as the ‘First and Last Pub in England’ due to the Scottish border only being a mile away!

It’s a true rural pub that’s family-friendly with something for everyone. A place where you’re always welcome.

From the kitchen, you can enjoy a delicious seasonal menu with many dishes to choose from. Our Sunday roasts alone are worth popping in for!

We’ll also be stepping up our entertainment programme to include movie nights, a monthly quiz night, live music – as well as a range of food themed nights such as curry night.

If it’s live sport you’re after, we’ve got that covered too! Our TV screens will be showing all the biggest matches on BT Sport.

In the warmer months, soak up the rays in our large beer garden. And don’t worry, we haven’t forgot the dogs either. That’s right – our four-legged friends are welcome!
