**The Masons Arms is an attractive village pub located in the stunning town of Frome in eastern Somerset.**

Located on Marston Road, we’re renowned for our quality food and real ales. These are complemented by a comprehensive range of craft beers, wines, spirits, fresh coffee and soft drinks.

From the kitchen, we’ve introduced a great new menu with even more dishes to choose from including smoked haddock in Cheddar sauce and a beef & ale stew in a large Yorkshire pudding! 

We have BT Sport showing some of the best sporting events you would expect to see. And on a Monday, we’ve got our ever-popular Masons quiz night!

Our welcoming, chic restaurant area encompasses a wide range of tailorable areas, each of which has its own potential for events, parties and meetings. The spaces are perfect for private dining, work dos and much, much more.

Whether you are a local to the area or just visiting, our friendly team will make you feel at home. We’re even dog-friendly in our bar area, with plenty of dog treats available!
