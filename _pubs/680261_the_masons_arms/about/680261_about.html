<p><strong>The Masons Arms is an attractive village pub located in the stunning town of Frome in eastern Somerset.</strong></p>

<p>Located on Marston Road, we’re renowned for our quality food and real ales. These are complemented by a comprehensive range of craft beers, wines, spirits, fresh coffee and soft drinks.</p>

<p>From the kitchen, we’ve introduced a great new menu with even more dishes to choose from including smoked haddock in Cheddar sauce and a beef &amp; ale stew in a large Yorkshire pudding!</p>

<p>We have BT Sport showing some of the best sporting events you would expect to see. And on a Monday, we’ve got our ever-popular Masons quiz night!</p>

<p>Our welcoming, chic restaurant area encompasses a wide range of tailorable areas, each of which has its own potential for events, parties and meetings. The spaces are perfect for private dining, work dos and much, much more.</p>

<p>Whether you are a local to the area or just visiting, our friendly team will make you feel at home. We’re even dog-friendly in our bar area, with plenty of dog treats available!</p>
