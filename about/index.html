<p><strong>What is it that you love about a proper local pub? The warm welcome, the sense of community, the relaxing atmosphere; maybe it's just the fact that a good local pub seems the right fit for any occasion.</strong> A quick pint after work with your mates or a relaxing meal when you just want somebody else to cook for a change, somewhere that makes you feel at home. That's what we think too. That's why we created Our Local - a fantastic and growing selection of proper local pubs. Pubs ran by passionate individuals; men and women that are waiting to welcome you and make you feel at home. So, what will it be? A pint of your usual?
</p>


<p>Our Local - inspired by a yearning for proper hospitality, the sort that is often forgotten in modern pubs and bars. We think it's important to sit down, take the weight off and make a little time for you and the important people in your life. Get the drinks in and grab a bite to eat while you relax, chat about the day and laugh together - you'll never get this time back.<br /><br /><strong>Come and visit us, drop in, feel at homeâ€¦</strong></p>
