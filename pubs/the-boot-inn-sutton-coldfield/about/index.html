<div><p>The Boot Inn’s building and its adjacent malthouse were built in the 1800s to serve the local community. The job of innkeeping was not enough for the person living there, so Joseph James moved into the Boot in 1843. James was a cordwainer – a maker of boots and shoes.</p> 
<p>James displayed a boot outside his premises to advertise his trade – so the reputation of the beer to be drank at the sign of the boot spread around the district.</p>
<p>The Boot Inn was first named in in the 1870s and was regarded as the centre of the growing community – which it still is today.
